Objective:
As of 2017, Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales pattern. Perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

Motivation: 
Instacart is highly interested in profiling variety their customers using their database to understand the purchasing behaviors. While Instacart cannot target everyone using the same methodology, they're considering a targeted approach to enhance their marketing strategy. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products. My analysis will inform what this strategy might look like to ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products.
